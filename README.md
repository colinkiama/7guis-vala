# 7GUIs Vala

I got bored so I decided to complete the [7GUIs tasks](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) in Vala.


## Build instructions

**Setup build directory**

```sh
meson build
```

**Build project**

```sh
cd build
ninja
```
**Run program**

They are all in their respective folders in the build directory

e.g the counter program would be in this directory relative to the project root:

```sh
./build/1-counter/counter
```
